# Java Spring Project

I made this project as part of my App Development Frameworks module in my final year of university

This is my first time using Lombok in a project and I had fun playing around with it and learning what it could be used for

The application contains a local H2 Embedded database so you are welcome to try out the application for yourself on your local machine!
